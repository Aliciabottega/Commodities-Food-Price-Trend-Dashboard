  ### Project Overview
  
  This project analyzes food price trends over time to identify patterns, price volatility, and inflationary movements across food categories.
  The goal is to generate insights that support better decision-making by understanding how food prices change across periods.

  ### Data Source
  
  This data source is a "Nigerian Commodity Price and market.csv" file.
  
  ### Tools
  
     - Cleaning : Excel ( power query )
  
     - Dashboard : Excel

   ###  Data Cleaning
  
   The dataset required several cleaning steps to ensure accuracy and usability:

   - Standardized date formats for time-series analysis

   - Ensured price columns were stored in numeric / customized formats

   - Filtered out incomplete periods to avoid misleading trend calculations

   - Corrected inconsistent text formatting by standardizing capitalization across all categorical fields
 
    ###  Data Analysis
  
  During this analysis, I was able to :

  - Examine how food prices change over time (yearly/quarterly)

  - Calculate average prices by food category and period

  - Identify commodities with the highest and lowest price fluctuations

  - Compare prices across years to identify growth or decline patterns

  - Analyze market value based on volume
 
   ###  Results

  From the following analysis, I found out :

  - The average commodity price is ₦509

  - The food commodities with the highest & lowest prices were ' Millet' being the highest & 'Palm Oil' being the lowest
 
  - The Top Market based on volume was Dawanau with a total of '183,594M'
 
   ### Recommendations
    
  - Use quarterly or average monthly analysis instead of YoY when the year is incomplete
 
  - Monitor highly volatile food categories for early price increase signals
 
   ### Limitations

  - The dataset does not cover a full year for all periods, making Year on Year (YoY) comparisons less reliable.
 
  - The analysis is based only on the available food items and locations in the dataset and may not represent broader market trends
